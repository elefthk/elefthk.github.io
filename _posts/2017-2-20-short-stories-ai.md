title: Short Stories on AI 
---

I realized that creating this blog was far easier than meaningfully organizing the things that I wanted to say in it in the first place. So until I can put my thoughts in order for anything bigger, here is a small list of interesting short stories around the subject of AI.
- [Understand](https://web.archive.org/web/20140527121332/http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/under.htm) by Ted Chiang.
- [The Robot and the Baby](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/robotandbaby/robotandbaby.html) by John McCarthy
- [Short Story on AI](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/11/14/ai/) by Andrej Karpathy
- [The Lifecycle of  Software Objects](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2010/fiction_the_lifecycle_of_software_objects_by_ted_chiang) by Ted Chiang
- [The Egg](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) by Andy Weir. (ok this one is not about AI, but it is really nice; and [here](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_el.html) is its official translation in Greek)
