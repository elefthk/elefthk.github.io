title: This is a first effort

I realized that creating this blog was far easier than meaningfully organizing the things that I wanted to say in it in the first place. So my first post will be a small list of interesting short stories around the subject of AI.

I thought about creating a list of short stories on AI.but first lets see how far i can write without it being cut by the read more line that we see in the bottom of every post. I was here the last time. It appears not to be enough. I was not cut off. How about now? Is this too much? Strange it wasn't.. maybe i copy a lot of stuff in here: lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu  eeeeeeeeeeeeeee

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
lalala :)
