title: Bash Cheat Sheet (higher level) 
---

This is not the type of cheat sheet that contains the basics of shell programming or tables of commands and good practices. For these purposes I recommend [1](http://johnstowers.co.nz/pages/bash-cheat-sheet.html), [2](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf) and [3](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/122b12050f5fb267e75f). 
Instead, here I have gathered some more complex commands that I have found useful working in the field of computer vision and machine learning.

`convert dragon.jpg -resize 50% half_dragon.jpg` | decrease image size by half and [more](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/)
`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 audio.mp3` | extract audio from video, [here](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) is the manual
