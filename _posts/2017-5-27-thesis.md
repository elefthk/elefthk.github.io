This is a blog post describing my master thesis project on View Synthesis in the context of Multiview Video \(carried out in 2015\). The aim of this post is to present the basic idea of the project and not to be a math lecture so expect not to be swamped with equations.

Equation here $$x_1$$

$$
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
$$
